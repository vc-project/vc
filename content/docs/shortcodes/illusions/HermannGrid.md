# Hermann Grid
The Hermann grid illusion is an optical illusion reported by Ludimar Hermann in 1870. The illusion is characterized by "ghostlike" 
grey blobs perceived at the intersections of a white (or light-colored) grid on a black background. The grey blobs disappear when 
looking directly at an intersection.

## Illusion

Ludimar Hermann, a German physiologist, discovered this illusion reading a physics text in which the figures were printed in a
matrix-like arrengement.

Inverted Hermann Grid, also known as Hering Grid. Hering noted the same illusory effect can be obteined in a black grid with white
squares.

The Hermann Grid is a case of hallucination, caused by the perception of the grid, this perception is given by the inhibitory processes
in the retinal ganglion cells, the neurons that transmit signals from the eye to the brain. Eachs cell corresponds to a small region
of the retina, where electrical respones are triggered, this receptive fields may overlap.
