# Zöllner Illusion

This illusion belongs to a family of illusions called geometrical-optical illusions. In these illusions some objects appear distorted in virtue of other aspects of the image and their geometrical properties as length, straightness, or parallelism are not correctly perceived.

The illusion consists of a series of parallel, diagonal lines which are crossed by short lines. The direction of the crossing lines alternate between horizontal and vertical. The created optical effect gets the observer to think that the diagonal lines are not parallel, but indeed they are.

## Creator

Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner (8 November 1834, Berlin – 25 April 1882, Leipzig) was a German astrophysicist. He was educated at the Humboldt University of Berlin and the University of Basel and later was appointed as professor at the university of Leipzig. His research covered mostly photometry and spectrum analysis studying topics such as the size and bright of stars. 

He had also a strong interest in optical illusions. In 1860, inspired by a cloth pattern that he observed in his father’s factory, he created the illusion and published it in the journal Annalen der Physik.

## Explanation

A very supported hypothesis on the working of this illusion states that our perceptual systems have a tendency to expand acute angles. Here the short lines that intersect the long lines cause the visual system to enhance the orientation contrast between the long and the short lines. This also produces the illusion that parallel lines are closer at some parts that on others. The expanded acute angle effect can be easily spotted in the following image:

## Philosofical aspects

Several philosofical problems can be associated to the field of optical illusions. Zöllner illusion is a classical illusion frequently cited in diverse philosofical debates on the nature of experience.

A first issue is about whether we are directly acquainted with the world or whether we are only acquainted with mental representations of it. A second issue states that it would seem to be that one can know that the lines are parallel but at the same time one experiences them as unparallel. This fact can help prove wrong the idea that perceptual states are based on believing.
