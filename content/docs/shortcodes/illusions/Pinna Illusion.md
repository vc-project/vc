# Pinna illusions

Pinna illusions encomposses various optical ilusions discovered by Dr. Baingio Pinna. We are gonna focus here on just two of them, composed by identical squares positioned in circular orbits around the center of the image. The position and shading of the squares creates the perception of spiraling orbits in the first one and in the second one the illusion of movement.

## Pinna's intertwining illusion

One can see an array of squares in a seemingly spiraling position. Nonetheless, the ilussion is made of concentric circles of slightly rotated squares.

## Pinna ilussion

The illusion shows a rotating motion effect. Each square is deliniated by two white and two black edges, which form a white and black vertex in each square, and are positioned in two concentric circles. All squared have the same width and orientation in relation to the center of the image, but the vertex orientation of the squares between circles is inverted. Looking at the center of the image makes the circles appear to rotate in opposite direction to each other. The apparent rotation is normally perceived in the peripheral vision when one moves in closer and farther from the image.

When we invert the polarity (of the vertex) the illusion reverses.

One can also missalign the squares without affecting the illusion as long as the general position is kept.

As applications one can see how in certain 3D environments, for example, in video games, these illusions can cause certain confusion. Placing them in the perifery of the players field of view could make them feel like something moved. The apparent movement of these illusions can in practice cause some desired confusion on the user.
