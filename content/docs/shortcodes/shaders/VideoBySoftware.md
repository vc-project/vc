### Software


Here we show a video processed frame by frame using the Software approach of image processing. This video consists of an mp4 file which is used to draw a photomosaic version of the video.

A Checkbox is displayed to show or hide the Photomosaic version of the video and a slider allows to change the sample patch size.
