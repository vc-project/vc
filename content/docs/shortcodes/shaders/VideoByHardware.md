### Hardware

Here we show a video processed frame by frame using the hardware approach of image processing.
GPU capabilities are used to improve performance. This video consists of an mp4 file which is used to draw a photomosaic version of the video.

Checkboxes are displayed to activate basic pixelator shader or Photomosaic versions of the video.
A slider allows to change sample patch size.
