Vectorial images consist of several lines, paths and shapes in a 2D or 3D environment that are defined mathematically to describe objects and scenes. A raster image uses a bitmap or set of pixels in the form of a grid or matrix to represent an image. Rasterization is important because pixel format is the format used in digital output image devices.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vc-project.github.io/vc/docs/shortcodes/rendering/Visibility-Algo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vc-project.github.io/vc/docs/shortcodes/rendering/Visibility-Algo/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://vc-project.github.io/vc/docs/shortcodes/rendering/Visibility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vc-project.github.io/vc/docs/shortcodes/rendering/Visibility/</guid><description>Visibility Alghoritms # Ray tracing # The videogames world has undergone a huge evolution in the last years. It has been posible by the GPU, the central component on which have been built. In the present, Ray tracing was here, but this technology is very demanding.The graphic boards like RTX 3090 and RX 6900 cant give the correct shape in the geometry level with the ray tracing method.</description></item></channel></rss>
