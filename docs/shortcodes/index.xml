This helps getting and adequate display resolution of textures and the improved resolution of the different specific scenes.
Description # This method is used to address the effect of aliasing, a frequent problem obtained when an image is presented in a different resolution from its original size.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vc-project.github.io/vc/docs/shortcodes/rendering/Visibility-Algo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vc-project.github.io/vc/docs/shortcodes/rendering/Visibility-Algo/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://vc-project.github.io/vc/docs/shortcodes/rendering/Visibility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vc-project.github.io/vc/docs/shortcodes/rendering/Visibility/</guid><description>Visibility Alghoritms # Ray tracing # The videogames world has undergone a huge evolution in the last years. It has been posible by the GPU, the central component on which have been built. In the present, Ray tracing was here, but this technology is very demanding.The graphic boards like RTX 3090 and RX 6900 cant give the correct shape in the geometry level with the ray tracing method.</description></item></channel></rss>
